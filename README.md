# Simple Next Day Planner

Create and manage your daily tasks in a simple way.

## Quick Overview

There's two main to do lists: Today and Tomorrow.

In each one you can create, edit and delete your tasks.

When the day changes, your tasks that were previously in the Tomorrow list, will be transferred to Today's list, leaving Tomorrow's list empty.

You can also shift one task from today to tomorrow and vice-versa.

Missed one task? No problem. In the History you can view your past tasks and if necessary transfer them to Today's or Tomorrow's list.
